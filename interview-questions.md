# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast arrays and hashes in Ruby. Include at least two differences and two similarities.

Your answer: Arrays and hashes can both contain data of various types and these values can be accessed directly with the correct key or index. Unlike arrays, hashes have keys which are defined on initialization or added to the hash while arrays have indicies which start at 0 and increase as values are added to the array.

Researched answer: 
    Similararities: Arrays and Hashes can store any Ruby object and can be iterated on.
    Differences: Arrays are orderd while hashes are unordered. Arrays have indecies and hashes have keys.

2. What does it mean to implement a TTD workflow?

Your answer: Test driven development means that you decide what your going to do, write tests that will only pass when your code does what you want it to do, and then write the code in a way that passes the test. After this you can refactor your code to improve efficency.

Researched answer: Test driven developement means writing the bare-minimum test to acheive failure, then writing the bare-minimum code to pass this test. By keeping our focus narrow and our code/tests minimal we're helping ensure that we catch details that may have gone overlooked if we were trying to stay too big-picture while writing our code.

3. Why would super be used in a Ruby class?

Your answer: Super is used to inherit methods from superclasses.

Researched answer: When using super withing a class, super would be invoked within a method of the same name as a method from the superclass. This allows the method from the superclass to be run before running any new code added by the subclass.

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer: Prototypal inheritance, used in JavaScript, allows objects to inherit from other objects while class-based inheritance, used in Ruby, follows a clear hierarchy up to BasicObject.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. PostgreSQL: An open-source, relational database management system.

2. Ruby on Rails: Web application framework written in Ruby.

3. Active Record: Alternative to SQL used in Rails to interact with relational databases.
